## About

The `useBattery` hook is a valuable tool for accessing and tracking the battery status of a user's device within a React application. This hook allows you to conveniently obtain details such as battery level, charging status, and estimated times for charging and discharging. It offers a state object that contains properties like `supported`, `loading`, `level`, `charging`, `chargingTime`, and `dischargingTime`.
