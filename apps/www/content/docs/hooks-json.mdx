title: hooks.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `hooks.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  Note: The `hooks.json` file is optional and **only required if you're using
  the CLI** to add components to your project. If you're using the copy and
  paste method, you don't need this file.
</Callout>

You can create a `hooks.json` file in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx scriptkavi-hooks@latest init
```

See the <Link href="/docs/cli">CLI section</Link> for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for `hooks.json` [here](https://hooks.scriptkavi.com/schema.json).

```json title="hooks.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://hooks.scriptkavi.com/schema.json"
}
```

## codestyle

The coding style for your hooks. This defines whether your hooks are react based or pure javascript. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="hooks.json"
{
  "codestyle": "react-hook"
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript hooks.

Setting this option to `false` allows hooks to be added as JavaScript with the `.js` file extension.

```json title="hooks.json"
{
  "tsx": `true` | `false`
}
```

## aliases

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated hooks in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Important:** If you're using the `src` directory, make sure it is included
  under `paths` in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.
</Callout>
