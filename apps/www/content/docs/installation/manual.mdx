### Configure path aliases

I use the `@` alias. This is how I configure it in tsconfig.json:

```json {3-6} title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `@` alias is a preference. You can use other aliases if you want.

**If you use a different alias such as ~, you'll need to update import statements when adding hooks.**

### That's it

You can now start adding hooks to your project.
